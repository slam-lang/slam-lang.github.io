    <h1>Basics</h1>
    <pre><code class="language-slam">{This is needed for the cstr class}
inc stdlib.slm

{This prints hello world}
proc main 0 0
  "Hello World" {Push hello world onto the stack}
  (cstr.println) {print the top of the stack}

  ret
end

{
Slam uses Reverse polish notation for math
instead of writing a operation b you
run a b operation, so for example 4 + 3 would
be
}

4 3 +
(int.print)

{
subtraction has an order still, you need to put the
2nd parameter second, 4 - 3 would be
}
4 3 -
(int.print)

{
slam by default has no division operation
instead it has /% which pushes the result and the
remainder to the stack. Though there are shortcuts
in stdlib.slm that allow you to / and % individually.
}
100 10 /%
(int.print)
(int.print)

{
this defines a proc named foo, it will
have access to the top 2 items in the
stack. And when it returns itll have 1
item in place of these 2.
}
proc foo 2 1
  {remove the top item in the stack}
  disc
  
  ret
end

{
an operation proc (which you'll see
the effects of in Calling procs) can
be defined by putting the identifier
oper before the name.
}
oper
proc bar 0 0
  
  ret
end

{you can also do this on the same line}
oper proc foo-op2 0 0

  ret
end

{you can call a proc by wrapping it in parentheses}

(foo)
            
{to call a operation proc just write its name}

bar

{
A block is created by wrapping a sequence of
operations in [], a block counts as one command.
This is useful for if statements
}
[
  (foo) bar
]
{
due to limitations in the slam compiler,
you cannot create a block inside a block.
}

{
an if statement pops the last item on the stack
if this item is 0 it skips the next command
}
100 10 /
10 == if [
  "10 / 100 is 10"
]

{
the class keyword can be used to create a class
}
class barc
  proc name 0 1
    "bar"
    ret
  end
  
  proc inherit 0 0
  
    ret
  end
end

{
you can use the of keyword to make a class inherit
from another
}
class fooc of barc
  proc name 0 1
    "foo"
    ret
  end
end

{items in a class are prefixed with classname.}
(fooc.name) (cstr.println)
(barc.name) (cstr.println)</code></pre>
    <h1>Intrinsics</h1>
    <pre><code class="language-slam">{
Slam has functions that are built into the compiler
these are called Intrinsics.
}

nop {this does nothing}
1 {writing any number pushes it to the stack}
disc {disc removes the top item from the stack}
1 2 + {+ adds the top 2 items in the stack}

1 2 . {. adds the top 2 items in the stack}
disc
1 2 - {- subtracts the top 2 items in the stack}

disc
1 2 * {* multiplies the top 2 items in the stack}
disc
1 2 /% {/% divides the top 2 items in the stack and pushes the result and remainder}
disc
1 2 swap {swap swaps the top 2 items in the stack}

copy read {read dereferences a pointer to an int}
disc
copy @ {@ dereferences a pointer to an int}

var makes a pointer to free memory with a size,
when outside a proc it requires a name
