      Basics
    </h2>
    <pre><code class="language-slam">{This is needed for the cstr class}
inc stdlib.slm

{This prints hello world}
proc main 0 0
  "Hello World" {Push hello world onto the stack}
  cstr.println {print the top of the stack}

  ret
end

{
Slam uses Reverse polish notation for math
instead of writing a operation b you
run a b operation, so for example 4 + 3 would
be
}

4 3 +
int.print

{
subtraction has an order still, you need to put the
2nd parameter second, 4 - 3 would be
}
4 3 -
int.print

{
slam by default has no division operation
instead it has /% which pushes the result and the
remainder to the stack. Though there are shortcuts
in stdlib.slm that allow you to / and % individually.
}
100 10 /%
int.print
int.print

{
this defines a proc named foo, it will
have access to the top 2 items in the
stack. And when it returns itll have 1
item in place of these 2.
}
proc foo 2 1
  {remove the top item in the stack}
  disc
  
  ret
end

{
an operation proc (which you'll see
the effects of in Calling procs) can
be defined by putting the identifier
oper before the name.
}
oper
proc bar 0 0
  
  ret
end

{you can also do this on the same line}
oper proc foo-op2 0 0

  ret
end

{the inverse of a oper proc is a push proc}
push proc foo2 0 0

  ret
end

{you can call a push proc by wrapping it in parentheses}

(foo)
            
{to call a operation proc just write its name}

bar

{you can push the address of a oper proc by wraping it in parentheses}

(bar) disc

{you can push the address of a push proc by writing its name}

foo disc

{you can also call a proc on the stack with parentheses}

foo ()

{
an if statement pops the last item on the stack
if this item is 0 it skips until a end is met
}
100 10 /
10 == if
  "10 / 100 is 10"
end

{
the class keyword can be used to create a struct
}
class barc
  proc name 0 1
    "bar"
    ret
  end
  
  proc inherit 0 0
  
    ret
  end
end

{
you can use the of keyword to make a class inherit
from another
}
class fooc of barc
  proc name 0 1
    "foo"
    ret
  end
end

{items in a class are prefixed with classname.}
fooc.name cstr.println
barc.name cstr.println</code></pre>

Slam has functions that are built into the compiler
these are called Intrinsics.
