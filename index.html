        The plan for January of 23 is to get slam2 working. There are many bugs to work out, I am going to start listing them on gh when I get a chance, feel free to work on PRs. Moving on I would like to fix this page on mobile, we'll see if I have time.
      </div>
      <div class="post-desc">
        I also have to fix the docs on this page, shouldnt be too difficult I just have to sweep the source for comments before definitions. The code will have to be commented aswell at a later time.
